<h1>**There is a CSS3 and JS file included in the HTML file***</h1>

<p>This is a project that I had been struggling to release for the past two weeks, due to issue via git. This is a project that
allows a user to enter their age, or year of birth, and compare it to a future year, or amount of years to determine their age
in "X" amount of years, or in the year "X".</p>

<p> The user gets the result via simple concatenation via Javascript. There are several features in this project, with a substansial
focus on CSS3 animation, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fade/In titles that are compatible with several modern browsers</li>
  <li>Background color changes every few seconds, reverting back to the original</li>
  <li>onmouseover/changecolor/backtonormal (Javascript) feature.</li>
</ul>
